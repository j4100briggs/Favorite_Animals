#### **1.** Raccoons have very dexterous hands. <br> **2.** There are six raccoon species native to North and South America. <br> **3.** The black bands around their eyes help them absorb incoming light and reduce glare, making it easier for them to see. <br> **4.** A raccoon lived in the White House once. <br> **5.** Raccoons can be found around the world due to humans. <br> [This is a cute picture of a raccoon!](http://pontus.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/width-constrained-728/public/527175-gettyimages-102883124_1.jpg?itok=jwlZlg5G) <br> [**This is a link to a raccoon riding a bike!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwtdIXWGry4)
